This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to my first To-Do App in React.
I made this to-do app, because it's one of the easiest things to have on your smartphone or computer. It's easy to use and won't take up much memory on your device.

HOW TO START THE PROJECT
To start up the project, install NodeJS and NPM.

1. Go to the terminal or command prompt.
2. Locate to the project file.
3. Type "npm start" to test or "npm start" to build.

HOW DOES IT WORK
1. Type in your to-do subject
2. Click on "voeg toe".
3. You can place the to do subject lower or higher by holding the mousebutton on the subject, and move it around.
4. To delete a subject, click the bin next to the to do subject.

NEXT VERSION
A next version would contain certain locational and time/date driven functions.
